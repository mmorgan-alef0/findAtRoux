Find@Roux is a custom web application tool that will provide a unique library service by assisting users navigate the stacks virtually, a “find in stacks” map for Roux Library, Florida Southern College.

## Summary ##
Find@Roux is a work in progress. In short, it is a stacks mapping solution, a digital approach to finding physical resources in the stacks that is always available and accessible from anywhere. In the first implementation phase, users will browse a digital map to identify subject areas and physical spaces on each floor. This is accessible from the library website. The second implementation phase will be integrated with EDS, the EBSCO Discovery Service where users will identify the location of each physical library item along with the title, call number, shelf number, and availability status.

Again, this code is provided as a *model*. It was inspired by work done by Ron Rilmour. More details about his project here: http://rgilmour70.github.io/stackMaps/. As Ron put it, all libraries have their own unique quirks: architectural, organizational, cataloging, etc. and these will need to be accounted for in any mapping system.

## Implementation ##
✓ Added Bulma, a free, open source CSS framework (https://bulma.io/) 
✓ Added Find@Roux maps for each floor
✓ Modified the code to add support for subject areas
✓ Highlighted multiple shelves on a map at the same time
✓ Fixed the static map using Bulma to make it responsive

## Customization ##
More details soon.
